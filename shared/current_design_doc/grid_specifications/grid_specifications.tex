\chapter{Summary}


This document will describe the required fields for a MPAS mesh. In addition, it
will define required orderings when creating an MPAS mesh. These together
should fully describe the MPAS mesh type and allow users to more easily
understand what makes an MPAS mesh.

%-----------------------------------------------------------------------

\chapter{Definitions and Conventions}

The meshes used by MPAS are Voronoi tessellations (VTs), in which MPAS
identifies three types of elements: {\it cells}, {\it edges}, and {\it
vertices}. {\it Cells} are simply the Voronoi cells in the tessellation, {\it
edges} are the boundaries between adjacent Voronoi cells, and {\it vertices}
are the corners of cells. In MPAS, cells are nominally located at the Voronoi
generating points, which, for centroidal Voronoi tessellations, are the mass
centoids of the Voronoi cells with respect to a density function, and edges are
nominally located at the midpoints of edges. Figure \ref{fig:voronoi} shows
three cells with their associated edges and vertices.

\end{center}
\end{figure}

The VT meshes used by MPAS may be defined on the Cartesian plane or on a
sphere. In the case of planar meshes, areas and distances are assumed to be
Euclidean, and the mesh is defined on the plane $z=0$. In the case of spherical
meshes, areas and distances are computed in spherical geometry; cells, edges,
and vertices are constrained to lie on the surface of the sphere, and the
sphere is centered at the origin, $(x,y,z)=(0,0,0)$. In all cases, the
coordinate systems assumed by MPAS meshes are right-handed. Figure
\ref{fig:planar_spherical} provides and illustration of VT meshes on the
Cartesian plane and on the sphere.

\chapter{General Mesh Requirements}

This chapter defines the general requirements for all MPAS meshes. Along with specific requirements for different element types (cell, edge, vertex). These include ordering specifications for one type of element relative to another.

\begin{itemize}
	\item MPAS meshes must be defined using a right handed coordinate system.
	\item Spherical grids must be centered at (0,0,0).
	\item Two arrays that are both relative to the element type must be ordered in the exact same way if possible.
	\item Input meshes are required to have a time dimension that is the unlimited (record) dimension.
\end{itemize}

When creating an MPAS mesh, it is recommended to ensure the correct ordering
relative to edges, then vertices, then cells. Ordering things in this way
simplifies the process.

\section{Requirements relative to edges}

At a given edge, two vectors $\vec{u}$ and $\vec{v}$ are defined as the normal and tangential vectors, respectively. These are defined as:
\begin{equation}
	\vec{u} = cellsOnEdge(2, iEdge) - cellsOnEdge(1, iEdge)
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
	\vec{v} = verticesOnEdge(2, iEdge) - verticesOnEdge(1, iEdge)
\end{equation}

\begin{itemize}
	\item The surface normal vector must be defined as $\vec{u} \times \vec{v}$.
	\item Angle edge must be the angle in radians $\vec{u}$ makes with the local eastward direction.
	\item edgesOnEdge must run counter-clockwise, beginning with the edges that surround cellsOnEdge(1, iEdge) and ending with the edges that surround cellsOnEdge(2, iEdge). \\
		  The current edge must be omitted from the list of edgesOnEdge, but can be assumed to be both the starting and ending position when checking for counter-clockwise ordering.
	\item weightsOnEdge must be ordered in exactly the same order as edgesOnEdge. i.e. weightsOnEdge(1, iEdge) can be assumed to apply to edgesOnEdge(1, iEdge).
\end{itemize}

\end{figure}

\section{Requirements relative to vertices}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Cells and Edges must run counter-clockwise around a given vertex.
	\item Edges must lead cells as they move around a vertex. \\
		  i.e. The vector defined by  \\
		  {\small $(cellsOnVertex(n, iVertex) - iVertex) \times (edgesOnVertex(n, iVertex) - iVertex)$} \\
		  must be surface normal, for all values of $n$.
	\item kiteAreasOnVertex(n, iVertex) is the intersection area of areaTriangle(iVertex) with areaCell(cellsOnVertex(n,iVertex)) for all values of $n$.
\end{itemize}

	\caption{Ordering of elements relative to vertices.}
\end{figure}

\section{Requirements relative to cells}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Cells, Edges, and Vertices all run counter-clockwise around a cell.
	\item The edge defined at edgesOnCell(n, iCell) must be on the edge between iCell and cellsOnCell(n, iCell) for all values of $n$.
	\item verticesOnCell(n, iCell) leads both edgesOnCell(n, iCell) and cellsOnCell(n, iCell) for all values of $n$. \\
		  i.e. The vector defined by \\
		  {\small $(edgesOnCell(n, iCell) - iCell) \times (verticesOnCell(n, iCell) - iCell)$} \\
		  must be surface normal for all values of $n$, or the substitution of cellsOnCell for edgesOnCell.
